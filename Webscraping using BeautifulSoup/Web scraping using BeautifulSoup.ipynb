    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a complete web scraping pipeline was implemented using\n",
    "BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from a publicly available website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective was to demonstrate how static HTML pages can be parsed and\n",
    "transformed into a structured dataset using Python, starting from exploratory\n",
    "analysis and progressing to a reusable scraping function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Website Used\n",
    "**https://quotes.toscrape.com**\n",
    "\n",
    "This website is publicly available, does not require authentication, and is\n",
    "specifically intended for web scraping practice and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Extracted\n",
    "- Quote text\n",
    "- Author name\n",
    "- Associated tags\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping Approach\n",
    "- Sent HTTP requests using the `requests` library.\n",
    "- Parsed HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "- Performed initial single-page exploration to understand HTML structure.\n",
    "- Encapsulated pagination logic into a reusable function for full-site scraping.\n",
    "- Identified and followed the \"Next\" page link to handle pagination.\n",
    "- Stored extracted data in a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- Exported the final dataset to a CSV file for downstream usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup is well-suited for exploratory and small-to-medium scale scraping tasks.\n",
    "- Pagination handling is essential for complete data extraction across multiple pages.\n",
    "- Refactoring exploratory code into functions improves readability and reusability."
